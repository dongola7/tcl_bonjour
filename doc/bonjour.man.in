[para]
This package provides script level access to the Bonjour library.
Bonjour allows registration of network services so that they
can easily be located by name and/or browsed for by service type.

[para]
The bonjour package currently supports browsing for services
and service name resolution.  Support for service registration is
planned in an upcoming version.

[para]
The bonjour package provides the following commands:
